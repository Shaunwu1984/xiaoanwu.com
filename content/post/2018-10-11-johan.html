<p>大清早起来看到约翰的长信，他刚刚从荷兰回北京可能正在倒时差。</p>
<p>我一点感慨如下：</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>这种学术的热情和精神正是我们所缺的。知道参加不了周五的读书会，本来在我们看来是免掉了一份负担，但是他却没有当成一份负担，而是提前把文章读了，还写出了这么大长串的评述，负责、认真的精神让人印象深刻，不要忘了他是一个快七十岁的“老人”，他依然有如此奔腾不息地去学习和思考。</p></li>
<li><p>我们从小的教育有巨大的问题，从来都告诉我们伟大是如此伟大，所以你的余生就是要去理解伟大，““将此身心奉尘刹”，从来没有教育我们去批判去反思理论有什么不对，伟人有什么瑕疵，以至于我们正在开始做学术的时候，却发现一个巨大的问题，我们早就不会思考和批判了 ！！！！！</p></li>

<p>Dear All,</p>
<p>I have to apologize: one more Friday that I will be traveling!</p>
<p>And that, while I find logic and causality such a great topic.</p>
<p>I read the Maudlin paper that you have lined up. Here is my impression, in case this is useful for your discussion to come.</p>
<p>It is very well-written, and makes an interesting case: that the correlation between causal judgments and counterfactual judgments is not of one defining the other, but mere correla- tion due to a shared factor: the role of laws in defining each.</p>
<p>He discusses a lot more, especially toward the end with ever more examples (at a stage where one would think the paper has already reached its natural end), but for a good seminar discussion, it would be best to focus on the essentials.</p>
<p>What are the arguments for the negative claim, that counter- factuals cannot define causality? He claims in one sentence that a Hume counterfactual is not necessary for a causal judgment, and takes more time over its not being sufficient. It would be good to get clear on the structure of this argument. I found two difficulties: what is the core of this argument, even if it is valid, and how does it show that no definition in terms of counterfactuals, no matter how complex, can do the job at all? Maybe all Maudlin shows is that no simple definition exists.</p>
<p>What also does not help is that Lewis at least provided some structured desiderata on a definition of causality that one can use to judge them – and he then shows that the regularity account fails these desiderata. In the present paper, I see no such explicit desiderata, making it harder to judge and compare approaches.</p>
<p>Next, as for the constructive aspect of the paper, the author’s own alternative account based on laws is not specified in any precise formal detail that I can see, and I found crucial features unclear, if one wants to grasp its formal ingredients. For instance, the status of laws is not clear in itself [historically, counterfactuals have been used to elucidate what makes a true law different from a mere generalization], and also, eventually, it turns out that the law-based account has parameters: context one has to specify in the model before causality-judgments can be made. This context- dependence is of course a general theme of our earlier emails.</p>
<p>I would also think that in many cases, we have no laws, especially in uses of counterfactuals in daily reasoning, or in statistical learning methods (both of them Fenrong’s points in a conversation today). So, how restricted is the law-like account in its scope?</p>
<p>As for the claim that causality and counterfactuals share a common core: viz. the role of laws, this is hard to judge as the author says little about how counterfactuals can be defined purely using the notion of law. Presumably, he has to make the case that the crucial similarity relation in Lewis semantics can be seen as always generated by a law. However, he just gives an example for showing this, not a general proof, and the example is so special (worlds generated by a physical process) that I cannot see how anything general follows from it for the many semantic settings covered by Lewis models, or Pearl models for that matter.</p>
<p>In other words, this paper has a totally different style from the philosophical logic approach taken by Lewis and other authors. While that is of course OK, and interesting, in itself, the distance to logic seems enormous. [Incidentally, Pearl-like models have been proposed in the 1980s by the philosopher of science Ron Giere, in order to say what scientific explanation and scientific laws really are – and a philosopher of science of that Pittsburgh type is much closer to logic than the Maudlin type.]</p>
<p>Final point. I liked the emphasis on Newtonian mechanics, but it is also very special. There is something counterfactual to the role of inertia in Newton’s axioms which one does not find in most theories in modern physics [Maudlin himself acknowledges this point]. So, how good a strategy is it to take Newton’s axioms as a model for what laws are in the whole enterprise of causality?</p>
